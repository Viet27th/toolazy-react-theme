 * Mooking import. The way to npm install a local library.
 * 
 * After you finish coding, bundle it, publish to npm and using it on another project. Suppose it is project A.
 * So, project A are using your library, you will get an Error: Minified React error #321,
 * Because there are two React instances in your project, ene is in your React project, and
 * another one is in the package you created. The solve this problem, you need to go to your library and:
 * + Config webpack.externals to remove React from bundle file.
 * 
 * + Config webpack.resolve: because your library still using React something like that: "import React from 'react'" 
 * so you need to tell Webpack use React dependency on A project instead on your library when Webpack is bundling.
 * If you don't specify this config, at the time Webpack bundling your library, it can't 
 * resolve to React dependency on your library.
 * 
 * + Config package.json "peerDependencies": Because your library needs to 
 * use React dependency, you must therefore addition React dependency here. By that way, anytime other 
 * projects install your library, all libraries in peerDependencies angle bracket will be install.
 * In other words, the code that includes your library must include all 
 * libraries below peerDependencies as its dependency.
 * 
 * + Remove "react dependency" below "dependencies angle bracket" of package.json, if not, when other project
 * install your library, it will create a new node_modules inside your library and lead to error.
 * Assum: Project A install your library, react version in your project A is 16.3.1 but in package.json of
 * your library, look at to "dependencies", your library are using React higher version. Your library will
 * auto-install react with a higher version and make a node_modules inside itself. So you should remove all
 * dependencies of your library if possible
